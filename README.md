# Senet
This ancient Egyptian game of Senet, coded in Python using tkinter as the GUI, was my final project for Stanford University class CS106A.

## Description
This Ancient Egyptian board game of Senet (meaning passing) was the ancestor of backgammon and held a lot of significance to pharaohs as the boards were often found it in their tombs. This game combines strategy, luck, and racing to get all pawns off the board.
